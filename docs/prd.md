# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Generate â‚¬50,000+ monthly affiliate revenue within 90 days through contextual ad traffic
- Achieve 15-20% click-to-lead conversion rate on high-intent promocode searches
- Maintain 100% ad network compliance rate with zero account suspensions
- Build a reusable, performant cloaking infrastructure for future campaigns
- Ensure sub-1.5s page load times with instant visual state (no FOUC)
- Implement robust two-stage protection against manual advertiser investigations

### Background Context

This project addresses a critical revenue opportunity in affiliate marketing by capturing high-value traffic from contextual ad networks (Yandex Direct, Google Ads) for queries that advertisers restrict - specifically branded promocode searches like "promocodes umschool". These searches represent users with immediate purchase intent but are typically off-limits due to advertiser keyword bidding restrictions. 

Our solution implements a sophisticated two-stage cloaking mechanism that serves compliant review content to ad network crawlers and investigators while delivering optimized promotional content to legitimate users within a 5-minute window. This approach leverages the time gap between real user searches (seconds) and manual investigations (hours/days) to maximize conversions while maintaining compliance.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The interface must deliver an immediate, frictionless experience for high-intent promocode seekers while maintaining the appearance of a legitimate review article. The design should prioritize mobile-first interactions with prominent promocode widgets that feel native to the content, not intrusive overlays. Visual hierarchy must guide users to conversion actions within 15-30 seconds.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **One-click code reveal**: Single tap to reveal and auto-copy promocodes with smooth animations
- **Instant visual feedback**: Clear confirmation when codes are copied with animated success states
- **Progressive disclosure**: Show discount amount first, then reveal code on interaction with slide/fade effects
- **Contextual placement**: Promocode widgets integrated naturally within article flow
- **Mobile gesture optimization**: Large touch targets, swipe-friendly navigation
- **Animated transitions**: Smooth reveal animations for code display and copy confirmation

### Core Screens and Views
- Article Landing Page (primary view with review content + promocode widgets)
- Promocode Modal/Dialog (expanded view with code details and CTA)
- Loading State (skeleton screen while fetching article/promocodes)
- Error State (fallback for API failures, maintains compliant appearance)

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Full WCAG AA compliance to ensure broad accessibility and reduce detection patterns. Includes proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.

### Branding
Clean, modern design that adapts to partner brand colors via CSS variables. Neutral base theme with accent colors pulled from partner logos. Typography should feel editorial/review-like rather than promotional.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
- Primary: Mobile web (70% of traffic) - optimized for iOS Safari and Chrome Android
- Secondary: Desktop browsers - full responsive design from 320px to 4K
- Progressive enhancement approach - core functionality works without JavaScript

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing the Next.js application with all components, utilities, and configurations. This simplifies deployment and maintains consistency across the codebase.

### Service Architecture
**Next.js Frontend with External Cloaking Service**. The application runs as a Next.js frontend that consumes cloaking decisions from an external API service. Server Components make initial API calls to get cloaking state, while API routes proxy client-side fingerprint verification requests. All cloaking logic resides in the external service.

### Testing Requirements
**Unit + Integration Testing Focus**. Unit tests for utility functions and React components. Integration tests for API routes and TDS communication. E2E tests for critical user flows (cloaking behavior, promocode interactions). Manual testing convenience methods for verifying cloaking states.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router (Server Components by default)
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, React Context for client state
- **API Communication**: Native fetch with proper timeout handling
- **Build Tools**: Turbo for fast builds, SWC for compilation
- **Deployment Target**: Platform-agnostic Next.js application
- **CDN Strategy**: Static assets served from edge locations
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for errors, PostHog for product analytics
- **Analytics Integration**: Google Tag Manager (GTM) container with:
  - Google Analytics 4 for traffic analysis
  - Yandex Metrica for Russian market insights
  - Custom events for promocode interactions
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers only (last 2 versions)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm for efficient dependency management
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, Husky for pre-commit hooks
- **Environment Management**: .env files with validation via zod
