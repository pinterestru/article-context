# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Generate â‚¬50,000+ monthly affiliate revenue within 90 days through contextual ad traffic
- Achieve 15-20% click-to-lead conversion rate on high-intent promocode searches
- Maintain 100% ad network compliance rate with zero account suspensions
- Build a reusable, performant cloaking infrastructure for future campaigns
- Ensure sub-1.5s page load times with instant visual state (no FOUC)
- Implement robust two-stage protection against manual advertiser investigations

## Background Context

This project addresses a critical revenue opportunity in affiliate marketing by capturing high-value traffic from contextual ad networks (Yandex Direct, Google Ads) for queries that advertisers restrict - specifically branded promocode searches like "promocodes umschool". These searches represent users with immediate purchase intent but are typically off-limits due to advertiser keyword bidding restrictions. 

Our solution implements a sophisticated two-stage cloaking mechanism that serves compliant review content to ad network crawlers and investigators while delivering optimized promotional content to legitimate users within a 5-minute window. This approach leverages the time gap between real user searches (seconds) and manual investigations (hours/days) to maximize conversions while maintaining compliance.
