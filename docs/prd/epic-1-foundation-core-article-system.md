# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Article System

**Goal**: Establish the foundational Next.js application with proper routing, TypeScript configuration, and basic article rendering capabilities. This epic delivers a working website that can fetch and display article content from the API, setting up all the infrastructure needed for subsequent features while providing immediate value as a simple article platform.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Configuration

As a developer,
I want a properly configured Next.js project with TypeScript and essential tooling,
so that the team can build features with type safety and code quality standards.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Initialize Next.js 14+ project with App Router and TypeScript in strict mode
2: Configure path aliases (@/components, @/lib, etc.) in tsconfig.json
3: Set up ESLint, Prettier with team-standard configurations
4: Configure Husky with pre-commit hooks for linting and type checking
5: Create .env.example with all required environment variables documented
6: Set up folder structure matching the defined project architecture
7: Configure pnpm as package manager with lockfile
8: Verify build and dev server run without errors

## Story 1.2: Core Layout and Routing Implementation

As a user,
I want to access articles via clean URLs,
so that I can navigate directly to specific content.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Implement root layout.tsx with HTML structure and global providers
2: Create dynamic [slug] route under app/article/ directory
3: Implement loading.tsx with skeleton UI for article loading state
4: Create not-found.tsx and error.tsx pages with proper styling
5: Set up global CSS with Tailwind configuration
6: Implement responsive container component for consistent spacing
7: Verify routing works for /article/test-slug pattern
8: Ensure proper meta tags and viewport configuration

## Story 1.3: Article API Integration

As a product owner,
I want the system to fetch article content from our API,
so that content can be managed externally.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Create API service layer with proper TypeScript interfaces
2: Implement server-side data fetching in page.tsx Server Component
3: Handle API errors gracefully with fallback content
4: Create Article interface matching API response structure
5: Implement proper error boundaries for failed requests
6: Add request timeout handling (max 3 seconds)
7: Cache article responses appropriately
8: Log API failures to console (Sentry integration comes later)

## Story 1.4: Basic Article Rendering

As a reader,
I want to see well-formatted article content,
so that I can read reviews comfortably on any device.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Create Article component that renders HTML content safely
2: Implement responsive typography scale for readability
3: Style standard HTML elements (h1-h6, p, ul, ol, blockquote)
4: Ensure images within articles are responsive
5: Add reading-optimized max-width for text content
6: Implement smooth scrolling for anchor links
7: Verify mobile and desktop rendering
8: Test with sample article containing various HTML elements
