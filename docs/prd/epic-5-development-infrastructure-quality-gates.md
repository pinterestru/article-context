# Epic 5: Development Infrastructure & Quality Gates

## Overview

Establish robust development infrastructure and quality gates to ensure code reliability, maintainability, and team productivity. This epic focuses on the technical foundation that supports all development activities.

## Epic Goal

Create a comprehensive development infrastructure that automatically enforces code quality standards, prevents broken code from entering the repository, and provides developers with fast feedback loops.

## User Personas

- **Primary**: Development Team
- **Secondary**: DevOps Engineers, QA Engineers
- **Tertiary**: Project Managers

## Epic Success Criteria

1. All tests pass consistently in local development and CI/CD
2. Pre-commit hooks prevent broken code from being committed
3. Pre-push hooks ensure only tested code reaches the repository
4. Automated quality gates are in place for all code changes
5. Test execution is fast and reliable (< 30 seconds for unit tests)
6. Development workflow is smooth and interruption-free

## Business Value

- **Reduced Bugs**: Catch issues before they reach production
- **Faster Development**: Quick feedback loops for developers
- **Code Quality**: Consistent code standards across the team
- **Team Productivity**: Less time spent on manual testing and bug fixes
- **Risk Mitigation**: Prevent deployment of broken functionality

## Dependencies

- Epic 1: Foundation & Core Article System (Husky setup)
- Epic 4: Analytics & Monitoring Integration (Sentry error tracking)

## Story 5.1: Testing Infrastructure Enhancement

### Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** a reliable testing infrastructure with automated quality gates,
**so that** I can develop with confidence knowing that broken code won't reach the repository.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. All existing tests pass consistently in local development environment
2. Pre-commit hooks execute successfully and prevent commits when tests fail
3. Pre-push hooks run full test suite and block pushes on failure
4. Test execution time is optimized for developer productivity (< 30 seconds)
5. Git hooks provide clear, actionable error messages when tests fail
6. Testing infrastructure works across different environments (dev, CI)
7. Code coverage reporting is available and integrated into the workflow
8. Documentation exists for troubleshooting common test issues

### Functional Requirements

- Fix all currently failing tests in the codebase
- Ensure Husky git hooks are properly configured and functional
- Implement fast test execution strategy (parallel running, test optimization)
- Add test coverage reporting and thresholds
- Create troubleshooting documentation for common test failures

### Technical Requirements

- Integrate with existing Vitest testing framework
- Utilize existing Husky configuration from Story 1.1
- Ensure compatibility with pnpm package manager
- Support TypeScript strict mode testing
- Integrate with Sentry for test failure tracking

### Definition of Done

- [ ] All tests pass in clean environment
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks prevent commits with failing tests
- [ ] Pre-push hooks prevent pushes with failing tests
- [ ] Test execution completes in under 30 seconds
- [ ] Coverage reports are generated and accessible
- [ ] Documentation is updated with testing procedures
- [ ] Team can develop without git hook interruptions
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipeline is verified

### Priority

High - This story is foundational for all future development work and directly impacts developer productivity and code quality.
