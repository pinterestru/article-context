# Story 5.1: Testing Infrastructure Enhancement

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** a reliable testing infrastructure with automated quality gates,
**so that** I can develop with confidence knowing that broken code won't reach the repository.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All existing tests pass consistently in local development environment
2. Pre-commit hooks execute successfully and prevent commits when tests fail
3. Pre-push hooks run full test suite and block pushes on failure
4. Test execution time is optimized for developer productivity (< 30 seconds)
5. Git hooks provide clear, actionable error messages when tests fail
6. Testing infrastructure works across different environments (dev, CI)
7. Code coverage reporting is available and integrated into the workflow
8. Documentation exists for troubleshooting common test issues

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies

- Story 1.1: Project Setup and Configuration established Husky, ESLint, Prettier, and basic testing framework
- Story 4.5: Sentry Error Monitoring provides error tracking infrastructure that can be leveraged for test failures

### Current Testing Infrastructure Status

Based on Story 1.1 implementation:

- Vitest testing framework is configured
- Husky is installed for git hooks
- Pre-commit hooks configured for linting and type checking
- Pre-push hooks configured for type checking
- ESLint and Prettier are set up

### Issues to Address

Common problems that need to be resolved:

- Git hooks may not be executing properly
- Tests may be failing due to environment configuration issues
- Test execution may be too slow for effective development workflow
- Missing test coverage reporting and thresholds
- Lack of clear documentation for troubleshooting test issues

### Testing Framework Configuration

Based on [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:

```typescript
// vitest.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  test: {
    globals: true,
    environment: 'jsdom',
    setupFiles: ['./src/test/setup.ts'],
    coverage: {
      provider: 'c8',
      reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html'],
      exclude: [
        'node_modules/',
        'src/test/',
        '**/*.d.ts',
        '**/*.test.{ts,tsx}',
        'src/app/**/layout.tsx',
        'src/app/**/page.tsx',
      ],
      thresholds: {
        global: {
          branches: 70,
          functions: 70,
          lines: 70,
          statements: 70,
        },
      },
    },
  },
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': '/src',
    },
  },
})
```

### Git Hooks Configuration

Expected Husky configuration:

```json
// .husky/pre-commit
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

pnpm lint-staged
pnpm test:ci

// .husky/pre-push
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

pnpm type-check
pnpm test:coverage
pnpm build
```

### Package.json Scripts

Required scripts for testing infrastructure:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest",
    "test:ci": "vitest run",
    "test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage",
    "test:watch": "vitest --watch",
    "type-check": "tsc --noEmit"
  }
}
```

### Test File Structure

Based on [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-structure]:

```
src/
├── components/
│   └── __tests__/
├── lib/
│   └── __tests__/
├── app/
│   └── __tests__/
└── test/
    ├── setup.ts
    ├── utils.tsx
    └── mocks/
```

### Common Test Issues and Solutions

1. **Import path issues**: Ensure aliases work in test environment
2. **Mock configuration**: Proper MSW setup for API mocking
3. **Environment variables**: Test environment configuration
4. **TypeScript compilation**: Ensure test files compile correctly
5. **Async handling**: Proper async test patterns

### Performance Optimization Strategies

- Parallel test execution with Vitest workers
- Test file watching and incremental testing
- Optimized test setup and teardown
- Smart test selection based on changed files
- Proper mocking to avoid expensive operations

### Coverage Reporting Strategy

- Line coverage: > 70%
- Branch coverage: > 70%
- Function coverage: > 70%
- Statement coverage: > 70%
- Exclude test files, type definitions, and basic layout files
- Generate HTML reports for detailed analysis

### Documentation Requirements

1. **Developer Guide**: How to run tests, interpret results
2. **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and solutions
3. **Best Practices**: Testing patterns and standards
4. **Git Hook Guide**: Understanding and bypassing hooks when needed
5. **Coverage Guide**: Understanding coverage reports and requirements
